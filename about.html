          <p>I am a creative looking for content marketing, direct marketing,
            and creative writing work. Over the years, I have gained diverse
            experience in newspaper and radio journalism, podcasting, content
            marketing, and message design. In addition, I’ve gained considerable
            knowledge in the areas of graphics design, photography, and brand
            identity. Curiosity drives me to always learn more in new areas and
            to further my expertise in the areas I’ve already found great joy.
          </p>
          <p>Each time I was able to lend my skills to a new employer or in a
            new position, I added to my own tapestry of experience and met the
            needs of those who employed me. Concurrently, I learned from mentors
            and colleagues the importance of effective team communication and
            awareness of team member needs.
          </p>
          <p>In the beginning of my career I was offered the opportunity to work at The
            Record where I learned the art of the interview and advanced my skill as a
            writer. From there, my work with Men’s Development Institute and Johnnie
             Bennie Media helped me grow my technical knowledge of sound and video
             production as well as event programming and community relations. These
             experiences led me to an opportunity at Minnesota Public Radio where I
             trained to be a journalist under Gary Eichten. And most recently, I had the
             opportunity to build marketing infrastructure around the stories of 106 Group
             and their brand.
           </p>
          <p>With a robust career of strong leadership and creative problem solving to
            back me, I am excited for new opportunities to bring innovation and determined
            creativity to a new client in need of clear vision.
