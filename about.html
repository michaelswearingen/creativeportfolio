          <p>I am a creative looking for content marketing, direct marketing, and
            creative writing work. I have, over the years, gained diverse
            experience in newspaper and radio journalism, podcasting, content
            marketing, and message design. In addition, I've gained considerable
            knowledge in the areas of graphics design, photography, and brand
            identity. Curiosity drives me to always learn more in new areas and to
            further my expertise in the areas I've already found great joy.
          </p><br>

          <p>With a robust career of strong leadership and creative problem
            solving to back me, I am excited for new opportunities to bring
            innovation and determined creativity to a new client in need of
            clear vision.
